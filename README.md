## Introduction
As an analytical CRM specialist, I was tasked with deriving insights from the bankâ€™s customer data to help reduce churn, enhance service quality, and boost customer satisfaction. The analysis explores demographic details, customer exits, product usage, and financial metrics using Power BI. By understanding customer behavior, the bank can develop data-driven strategies to foster long-term relationships and retention.

## Problem Statement

- Analyze product holding trends and cross-sell opportunities.
- Understand the influence of credit scores and salaries on churn behavior.
- Segment customers by churn risk, age, and financial value.
- Recommend targeting and retention strategies based on customer value.
